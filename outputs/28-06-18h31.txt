 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_12 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_12 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_3 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_3 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_9 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_9 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_14 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_14 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_4 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_4 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_12 is speaker: False
device_3 is speaker: True
device_9 is speaker: False
device_14 is speaker: False
device_4 is speaker: False
validator device_3 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_3 - speaker hashing the block...
device_3 - speaker mines a block in 0.15609288215637207 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_3 is propagating its block to validator device_4.
validator device_4 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_3
validator device_3 is propagating its block to validator device_9.
validator device_9 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_3
validator device_3 is propagating its block to validator device_12.
validator device_12 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_3
validator device_3 is propagating its block to validator device_14.
validator device_14 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_3
accept block based on PoA
device_12 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_3 mined by device_3 has been verified by device_12!
Delegate device_12 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_3.
accept block based on PoA
device_9 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_3 mined by device_3 has been verified by device_9!
Delegate device_9 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_3.
accept block based on PoA
device_14 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_3 mined by device_3 has been verified by device_14!
Delegate device_14 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_3.
accept block based on PoA
device_4 - delegate 4/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_3 mined by device_3 has been verified by device_4!
Delegate device_4 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_3.

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_6 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_6 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_10 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_10 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_2 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_2 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_5 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_5 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_1 is speaker: True
device_6 is speaker: False
device_10 is speaker: False
device_2 is speaker: False
device_5 is speaker: False
validator device_1 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_1 - speaker hashing the block...
device_1 - speaker mines a block in 0.23406648635864258 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_6.
validator device_6 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_2.
validator device_2 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_10.
validator device_10 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_5.
validator device_5 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
accept block based on PoA
device_6 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_6!
Delegate device_6 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_1.
accept block based on PoA
device_10 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_10!
Delegate device_10 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_1.
accept block based on PoA
device_2 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_2!
Delegate device_2 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_1.
accept block based on PoA
device_5 - delegate 4/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_5!
Delegate device_5 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_1.
4/4 from delegates approved the candidate block

device_7 - validator 5/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 10 accepted transactions.

 Step 3 - validators do cross-validation (validate local updates from workers) 

validator device_5 is performing one epoch of local update and validation
validator device_5 locally updated model has accuracy 0.29040002822875977 on its local test set
device_5 - validator 1/5 is validating received worker transactions...
Signature of transaction from worker device_3 is verified by validator device_5!
validator updated model accuracy - 0.29040002822875977
After applying worker's update, model accuracy becomes - 0.20229993760585785
NOTE: worker device_3's updates is deemed as suspiciously malicious by validator device_5
Warning - device_3 is benign and this validation is wrong.
A validation process has been done for the transaction from worker device_3 by validator device_5
Signature of transaction from worker device_1 is verified by validator device_5!
validator updated model accuracy - 0.29040002822875977
After applying worker's update, model accuracy becomes - 0.27330002188682556
worker device_1's' updates is deemed as GOOD by validator device_5

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_5 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_5 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_13 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_13 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_14 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_14 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_12 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_12 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_7 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_7 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_5 is speaker: True
device_13 is speaker: False
device_14 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: False
device_7 is speaker: False
validator device_5 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_5 - speaker hashing the block...
device_5 - speaker mines a block in 0.23271441459655762 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_5 is propagating its block to validator device_7.
validator device_7 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_5
validator device_5 is propagating its block to validator device_13.
validator device_13 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_5
validator device_5 is propagating its block to validator device_12.
validator device_12 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_5
validator device_5 is propagating its block to validator device_14.
validator device_14 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_5
accept block based on PoA
device_13 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_5 mined by device_5 has been verified by device_13!
Delegate device_13 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_5.
accept block based on PoA
device_14 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_5 mined by device_5 has been verified by device_14!
Delegate device_14 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_5.
accept block based on PoA
device_12 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_5 mined by device_5 has been verified by device_12!
Delegate device_12 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_5.
accept block based on PoA
device_7 - delegate 4/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_5 mined by device_5 has been verified by device_7!
Delegate device_7 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_5.

device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_6 is speaker: False
device_2 is speaker: True
device_10 is speaker: False
device_4 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: False
validator device_2 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_2 - speaker hashing the block...
device_2 - speaker mines a block in 0.18307828903198242 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_2 is propagating its block to validator device_6.
validator device_6 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_2
validator device_2 is propagating its block to validator device_4.
validator device_4 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_2
validator device_2 is propagating its block to validator device_10.
validator device_10 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_2
validator device_2 is propagating its block to validator device_1.
validator device_1 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_2
accept block based on PoA
device_6 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_2 mined by device_2 has been verified by device_6!
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_6 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_6 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_6 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_2.
accept block based on PoA
device_10 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_2 mined by device_2 has been verified by device_10!
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_10 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_2.
accept block based on PoA
device_4 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_2 mined by device_2 has been verified by device_4!
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_4 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_2.
accept block based on PoA
device_1 - delegate 4/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_2 mined by device_2 has been verified by device_1!
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_1 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_1 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_1 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_2.

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_14 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_14 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_15 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_15 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_11 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_11 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_5 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_5 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_14 is speaker: False
device_15 is speaker: True
device_11 is speaker: False
device_5 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: False
validator device_15 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_15 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_15 - speaker hashing the block...
device_15 - speaker mines a block in 0.18167829513549805 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_11.
validator device_11 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_5.
validator device_5 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_14.
validator device_14 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_1.
validator device_1 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
accept block based on PoA
device_14 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_15 mined by device_15 has been verified by device_14!
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_14 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_15.
accept block based on PoA
device_11 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_15 mined by device_15 has been verified by device_11!
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_11 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_15.
accept block based on PoA
device_5 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_15 mined by device_15 has been verified by device_5!
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_5 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_5 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_15.

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_10 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_10 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_12 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_12 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_6 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_6 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_9 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_9 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_2 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_2 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_10 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: True
device_6 is speaker: False
device_9 is speaker: False
device_2 is speaker: False
validator device_12 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_12 - speaker hashing the block...
device_12 - speaker mines a block in 0.17973637580871582 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_12 is propagating its block to validator device_6.
validator device_6 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_12
validator device_12 is propagating its block to validator device_2.
validator device_2 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_12
validator device_12 is propagating its block to validator device_10.
validator device_10 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_12
validator device_12 is propagating its block to validator device_9.
validator device_9 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_12
accept block based on PoA
device_10 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_12 mined by device_12 has been verified by device_10!
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_10 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_12.
accept block based on PoA
device_6 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_12 mined by device_12 has been verified by device_6!
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_6 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_6 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_6 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_6 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_12.
accept block based on PoA
device_9 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_12 mined by device_12 has been verified by device_9!
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_9 because its in black list or it's not well voted

device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_5 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_5 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_12 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_12 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_4 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_4 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_15 is speaker: True
device_1 is speaker: False
device_5 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: False
device_4 is speaker: False
validator device_15 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_15 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_15 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_7 by device_15 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_15 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_15 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_15 - speaker hashing the block...

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_14 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_14 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_6 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_6 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_10 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_10 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_2 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_2 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_14 is speaker: True
device_6 is speaker: False
device_10 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: False
device_2 is speaker: False
validator device_14 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_7 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_3 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_14 - speaker hashing the block...
device_14 - speaker mines a block in 0.23304080963134766 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates

device device_7 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_7 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_5 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_5 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_10 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_10 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

device_15 is speaker: True
device_7 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: False
device_5 is speaker: False
device_10 is speaker: False
validator device_15 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_2 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_2 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_11 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_11 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_3 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_3 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_7 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_7 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_4 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_4 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_2 is speaker: False
device_11 is speaker: False
device_3 is speaker: False
device_7 is speaker: False
device_4 is speaker: True
validator device_4 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_12 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_13 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_4 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_4 - speaker hashing the block...
device_4 - speaker mines a block in 0.17630982398986816 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_4 is propagating its block to validator device_7.
validator device_7 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_4
validator device_4 is propagating its block to validator device_2.
validator device_2 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_4
Destination miner device_3 is in validator device_4's black_list. Propagating skipped for this dest miner.
validator device_4 is propagating its block to validator device_11.
validator device_11 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_4
accept block based on PoA
device_2 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_4 mined by device_4 has been verified by device_2!
global update skipped for worker device_12 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_13 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_2 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_4.
accept block based on PoA
device_11 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_4 mined by device_4 has been verified by device_11!
global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_12 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted

Delegate device_11 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_4.
accept block based on PoA
device_7 - delegate 4/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_4 mined by device_4 has been verified by device_7!
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_7 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_12 by device_7 because its in black list or it's not well voted

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_12 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_12 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_3 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_3 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_11 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_11 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_14 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_14 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_12 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: True
device_3 is speaker: False
device_11 is speaker: False
device_14 is speaker: False
validator device_1 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_1 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_1 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_2 by device_1 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_1 - speaker hashing the block...
device_1 - speaker mines a block in 0.1777966022491455 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
Destination miner device_3 is in validator device_1's black_list. Propagating skipped for this dest miner.
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_11.
validator device_11 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_12.
validator device_12 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
validator device_1 is propagating its block to validator device_14.
validator device_14 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_1
accept block based on PoA
device_12 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_12!
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_2 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_12 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_1.
accept block based on PoA
device_11 - delegate 3/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_11!
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_2 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
Delegate device_11 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_1.
accept block based on PoA
device_14 - delegate 4/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_1 mined by device_1 has been verified by device_14!
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_2 by device_14 because its in black list or it's not well voted

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_8 is speaker: True
device_14 is speaker: False
device_7 is speaker: False
device_5 is speaker: False
device_6 is speaker: False
validator device_8 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_15 is speaker: False
device_14 is speaker: False
device_6 is speaker: False
device_7 is speaker: True
device_5 is speaker: False
validator device_7 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_7 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_7 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_4 by device_7 because its in black list or it's not well voted

 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_11 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_11 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_14 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_14 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_15 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_15 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_9 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_9 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_6 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_6 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_11 is speaker: False
device_14 is speaker: False
device_15 is speaker: True
device_9 is speaker: False
device_6 is speaker: False
validator device_15 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_15 - speaker hashing the block...
device_15 - speaker mines a block in 0.17903590202331543 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_6.
validator device_6 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_11.
validator device_11 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_9.
validator device_9 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
validator device_15 is propagating its block to validator device_14.
validator device_14 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_15
accept block based on PoA
device_11 - delegate 1/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_15 mined by device_15 has been verified by device_11!
Delegate device_11 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_15.
accept block based on PoA
device_14 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_15 mined by device_15 has been verified by device_14!

validator device_3 5/5 did not receive any broadcasted worker transaction this round.
device_3 - validator 5/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 0 accepted transactions.

 Step 3 - validators do cross-validation (validate local updates from workers) 

validator device_1 is performing one epoch of local update and validation
validator device_1 locally updated model has accuracy 0.6936999559402466 on its local test set
device_1 - validator 1/5 is validating received worker transactions...
Signature of transaction from worker device_6 is verified by validator device_1!
validator updated model accuracy - 0.6936999559402466
After applying worker's update, model accuracy becomes - 0.6284999847412109
worker device_6's' updates is deemed as GOOD by validator device_1
A validation process has been done for the transaction from worker device_6 by validator device_1
Signature of transaction from worker device_11 is verified by validator device_1!
validator updated model accuracy - 0.6936999559402466
After applying worker's update, model accuracy becomes - 0.37950003147125244
NOTE: worker device_11's updates is deemed as suspiciously malicious by validator device_1

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_3 is speaker: True
device_7 is speaker: False
device_13 is speaker: False
device_8 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: False
validator device_3 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_3 - speaker did not receive any transaction from validator or miner in this round.

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_3 is speaker: True
device_7 is speaker: False
device_13 is speaker: True
device_8 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: False
validator device_13 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_13 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_13 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_13 because its in black list or it's not well voted

global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_13 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_2 by device_13 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_13 - speaker hashing the block...
device_13 - speaker mines a block in 0.2260901927947998 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_13 is propagating its block to validator device_7.
validator device_7 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_13
Destination miner device_3 is in validator device_13's black_list. Propagating skipped for this dest miner.
validator device_13 is propagating its block to validator device_12.
validator device_12 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_13
validator device_13 is propagating its block to validator device_8.
validator device_8 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_13
accept block based on PoA
device_7 - delegate 2/4 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_13 mined by device_13 has been verified by device_7!

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_14 is speaker: False
device_5 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: True
device_2 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: False
validator device_12 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_4 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_11 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_12 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_12 - speaker hashing the block...
device_12 - speaker mines a block in 0.17551136016845703 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_8 is speaker: False
device_11 is speaker: True
device_7 is speaker: False
device_6 is speaker: False
device_9 is speaker: False
validator device_11 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_2 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_12 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_10 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_4 by device_11 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_11 - speaker hashing the block...
device_11 - speaker mines a block in 0.17583608627319336 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_11 is propagating its block to validator device_7.
validator device_7 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_11
validator device_11 is propagating its block to validator device_6.
validator device_6 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_11
validator device_11 is propagating its block to validator device_9.
validator device_9 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_11
