 Step 6 - aggregate accuracy gains calculated by all validators for each worker
device device_3 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_3 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_1 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_1 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_9 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_9 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_20 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_20 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_17 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_17 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_13 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_13 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains
device device_12 is summing acctacy gains
validator device_12 has aggregated accuracy gains from all the received accuracy gains

 Step 7 - begin consensus

 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
device_3 is speaker: False
device_1 is speaker: False
device_9 is speaker: True
device_20 is speaker: False
device_17 is speaker: False
device_13 is speaker: False
device_12 is speaker: False
validator device_9 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0

 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_9 - speaker hashing the block...
device_9 - speaker mines a block in 0.30919456481933594 seconds.

 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_9 is propagating its block to validator device_1.
validator device_1 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_9
validator device_9 is propagating its block to validator device_20.
validator device_20 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_9
validator device_9 is propagating its block to validator device_12.
validator device_12 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_9
validator device_9 is propagating its block to validator device_17.
validator device_17 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_9
validator device_9 is propagating its block to validator device_3.
validator device_3 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_9
validator device_9 is propagating its block to validator device_13.
validator device_13 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_9
accept block based on PoA
device_3 - delegate 1/6 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_9 mined by device_9 has been verified by device_3!
Delegate device_3 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_9.
accept block based on PoA
device_1 - delegate 2/6 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_9 mined by device_9 has been verified by device_1!
Delegate device_1 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_9.
accept block based on PoA
device_20 - delegate 3/6 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_9 mined by device_9 has been verified by device_20!
Delegate device_20 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_9.
accept block based on PoA
device_17 - delegate 4/6 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_9 mined by device_9 has been verified by device_17!
Delegate device_17 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_9.
accept block based on PoA
device_13 - delegate 5/6 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_9 mined by device_9 has been verified by device_13!
Delegate device_13 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_9.
accept block based on PoA
device_12 - delegate 6/6 is deciding if a valid propagated block received 
Block accepted from miner device_9 mined by device_9 has been verified by device_12!
Delegate device_12 signed the propagated block proposed by speaker device_9.
6/6 from delegates approved the candidate block
