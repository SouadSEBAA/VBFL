 Step 7 - begin consensus
 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
validator device_10 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0
 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
device_10 - speaker hashing the block...
device_10 - speaker mines a block in 0.12325906753540039 seconds.
 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_10 is propagating its block to validator device_4.
validator device_4 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_10
validator device_10 is propagating its block to validator device_1.
validator device_1 has accepted accepted a propagated block from miner device_10

 Step 7 - begin consensus
 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
validator device_2 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0
 Step 7.2 - build candidate block
global update skipped for worker device_12 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_8 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_2 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_2 - speaker hashing the block...
device_2 - speaker mines a block in 0.18067145347595215 seconds.

 Step 2.5 - with the broadcasted workers transactions, validators decide the final transaction arrival order 

device_2 - validator 1/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_2 - validator 1/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 10 accepted transactions.
device_6 - validator 2/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
device_6 - validator 2/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 10 accepted transactions.

After applying worker's update, model accuracy becomes - 0.4837000072002411
worker device_4's' updates is deemed as GOOD by validator device_10
A validation process has been done for the transaction from worker device_4 by validator device_10
 Step 4 - validators broadcast calculated accuracy gains to other validators
device_2 - validator 1/5 is broadcasting its calculated acc_gain (via transactions)...

 Step 7 - begin consensus
 Step 7.1 - choose speaker among delegates (validators)
validator device_10 has been chosen as speaker for the consensus round 0
 Step 7.2 - build candidate block

global update skipped for worker device_14 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
global update skipped for worker device_9 by device_10 because its in black list or it's not well voted
device_10 - speaker hashing the block...
device_10 - speaker mines a block in 0.2385406494140625 seconds.
 Step 7.3 - propose it to delegates
validator device_10 is propagating its block to validator device_8.

 Step 2.5 - with the broadcasted workers transactions, validators decide the final transaction arrival order 

device_15 - validator 1/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
validator device_15 1/5 did not receive any broadcasted worker transaction this round.
device_15 - validator 1/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 0 accepted transactions.
device_13 - validator 2/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
validator device_13 2/5 did not receive any broadcasted worker transaction this round.
device_13 - validator 2/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 0 accepted transactions.
device_4 - validator 3/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
validator device_4 3/5 did not receive any broadcasted worker transaction this round.
device_4 - validator 3/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 0 accepted transactions.
device_1 - validator 4/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
validator device_1 4/5 did not receive any broadcasted worker transaction this round.
device_1 - validator 4/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 0 accepted transactions.
device_5 - validator 5/5 is calculating the final transactions arrival order by combining the direct worker transactions received and received broadcasted transactions...
validator device_5 5/5 did not receive any broadcasted worker transaction this round.
device_5 - validator 5/5 done calculating the ordered final transactions arrival order. Total 0 accepted transactions.
 Step 3 - validators do cross-validation (validate local updates from workers) 

device_15 - validator 1/5 did not receive any transaction from worker or validator in this round.
device_13 - validator 2/5 did not receive any transaction from worker or validator in this round.
device_4 - validator 3/5 did not receive any transaction from worker or validator in this round.
device_1 - validator 4/5 did not receive any transaction from worker or validator in this round.

device_13 - validator 2/5 is broadcasting its calculated acc_gain (via transactions)...
device_4 - validator 3/5 is broadcasting its calculated acc_gain (via transactions)...
device_1 - validator 4/5 is broadcasting its calculated acc_gain (via transactions)...
device_5 - validator 5/5 is broadcasting its calculated acc_gain (via transactions)...
 Step 5 - validators verify transactions received from other validators
